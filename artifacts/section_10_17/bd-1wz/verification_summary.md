## Implementation Summary

Section 10.17 delivers the Radical Expansion track covering:
- Proof-carrying speculation with guard-based fallback
- Bayesian adversary risk modeling with automated quarantine
- Time-travel deterministic replay for extension-host workflows
- Zero-knowledge compliance attestation
- N-version semantic oracle for cross-runtime divergence detection
- Security staking/slashing for publisher trust governance
- Self-evolving optimization with safety-envelope bounds
- Intent-aware firewall for extension remote effects
- Information-flow lineage tracking with exfiltration detection
- Universal verifier SDK with replay capsule format
- Heterogeneous hardware placement with policy evidence
- Counterfactual incident analysis with ranked mitigations
- Claim compiler with public trust scoreboard

## Notes

This epic is dependency-only orchestration. All implementation was delivered by
the child beads. Closing this epic confirms section 10.17 convergence is complete
and downstream sections (10.12, 10.18-10.21) can proceed.
